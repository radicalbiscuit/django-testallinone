# YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS IN YOUR PROJECT!

## django-testallinone
Test app created as a proof-of-concept for http://stackoverflow.com/q/32622021/895755. It keeps app, static, and template files all in the same directory (the base app directory).

Tested with Django 1.8.4 and its dev server.

Forgive me.
